        "The necessity of founding such an educational institution appeared as a result of the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, when there were practically no specialists professionally trained for minimization of the consequences of radiation accidents. Following the initiatives of the International Congress of memory of Andrei Sakharov “Peace, progress, human rights” and the program “Chernobyl” controlled by the United Nations Organization, Sakharov college was inaugurated in Minsk. The next stage of the development was 1994, when after the resolution of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Belarus the college became independent International Institute of Radioecology. In 1999 after the state accreditation the Institute acquired the status of University."
